## Overview

CNN‑Intel‑Identifier is a Convolutional Neural Network-based image classification tool designed to identify Intel product images or distinguish Intel hardware (or relevant Intel‑related image categories). The project includes both the model and a web UI for prediction.

---

## Features

- Image upload & prediction via web app  
- Trained CNN model (`cnn_model.h5`) for classification  
- Supports testing & evaluation  
- Interactive notebook for exploring image pre-processing & predictions

---

## Architecture

- **Model:** A CNN architecture saved as `cnn_model.h5`  
- **Frontend / UI:** `app.py` (likely using Gradio or other framework) for user interaction  
- **Notebooks:** `image.ipynb` for preprocessing / demonstrations  
- **Data splits:** Directories like `seg_train`, `seg_test`, `seg_pred` (for training, testing, prediction data subsets)

---

## Installation

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Then:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/NithyaShriSK/CNN-intel_identifier.git
cd CNN-intel_identifier

# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

1. Ensure the `cnn_model.h5` model is in the project directory.  
2. Prepare your image(s) for prediction.  
3. Run the app:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Open the link provided (e.g., from Gradio) in your browser.  
5. Upload image → get prediction.

You can also use the notebook `image.ipynb` to see how images are preprocessed and how predictions are made.

- **app.py** — Main script to launch the web interface  
- **cnn_model.h5** — Saved CNN model weights  
- **image.ipynb** — Notebook to explore preprocessing / visualization  
- **seg_train**, **seg_test**, **seg_pred** — Directories for training / testing / prediction data  

---

## Dependencies

Some of the main packages used:

- `tensorflow` or `keras`  
- `numpy`  
- `Pillow` (for image handling)  
- `gradio` (if app uses Gradio for UI)  
- Any other listed in `requirements.txt`

---

## Training

To train your own model:

1. Place your labeled images into `seg_train` (with subfolders per class).  
2. Adjust any configuration in the notebook or training script if available.  
3. Train using TensorFlow / Keras.  
4. Save model as `.h5` or other format.
